# BMI / SPI Test

Example of trying, and failing, to put the BMI / SPI code from the
STM32H7 examples into its own class.

* bmi0 -- original example project, adjusted for location
* bmi1 -- failed attempt

The MODM submodule is not included in this sample repo.
These directories should be placed in an existing project structure:

* project
  - ext
    * modm
  - bmi0
  - bmi1
